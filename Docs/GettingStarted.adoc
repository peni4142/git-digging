== Getting Started

* To get started, start the docker composition `docker compose up`.
* Then, run the script in the git directory, that you want to analyze. 
* Define the datasource and import the dashboard 
** Connect to port 3000 `http://localhost:3000/`
** Fill in the user: "admin" password: "admin", you have to reset the password. 
** Go to "Connections"/"Add new Connection"
** Search for "PostgreSQL", click it, and click "Add new data source" fill in the connection data into the form:

| Label| Value

| Host URL
| database

| Database name

| Username

| PASSWORD

|TLS/SSL Mode

** Let the rest by default and click "Save & test"
** Go to "Dashboards", *NOT* "building a Dashboard", click "New" and "Import"
** Upload the file "grafana-import.json"
** Choose your "grafana-postgresql-database"
** Click Import

*Yes, the Getting Started section is longer than I like, so if you have any ideas about improving it, I would like to hear them.*
